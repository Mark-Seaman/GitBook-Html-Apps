# Introduction

Building a website is not difficult but there are a lot of pieces that must all work together.  To be productive you must master around fifty different skills. Each skill is relatively easy to learn, but is takes practice to get good at it.

### Time and Practice

Learning a new skill starts by doing it once. Sometime, it can be daunting to know where to begin when doing something for the first time.  It is often useful to get a recipe for one successful way to get to a good result.

This lets you mimic the skill without any understanding of why it works.  This instant success gives the confidence to try new ways of performing the skill with the knowledge that you can always go back to the default way that works.

Most of the skills taught in this book require less than ten lines of code and only one new concept.  A successful outcome can be produced in around 10 minutes. This does not make you a master but it does allow you to become a beginner by producing the desire result and effectively utilizing the new skill.

To totally master each of the skills requires doing them multiple times in different contexts. Each time you change the context new variables are introduced that will break the implementation.  Debugging this new context is what ultimately makes you competent in the skill.

Skill is driven by understand which ultimately can be measured in hours.  About ten hours of experience is required to master each of the fifty skills presented here.   Once you have mastered a skill it can be easily applied in a project in less than an hour.

### Skill and Cost

Building a website is nothing more than applying about fifty tricks.  An experienced engineer can be expected to complete a full implementation of a website in about fifty hours if no new skills are needed.  A novice will require about fifty days to build the same web site because the bulk of the time will be spent learning new skills.

This learning curve alone accounts for the well-documented performance variation that exists between software developers.  The most effective developers are more than ten times as productive as the worst.

### Jump-starting Skills

The first barrier that and engineer faces is that they do not understand what skills are currently lacking.  The engineer is typically given an assignment that may require three or four new skills. They may feel an emotional resistance to getting started but not understand the reason why.

A key breakthrough may be initiated by getting designers to think in very concrete terms about skills that are required.  This allows every engineer to assemble a list of skills that are needed for their current job and to create a plan for how they can learn any missing ones.

One goal of this book is to give engineers a catalog of skills that they are likely to need in order to complete the most common tasks.  A personal can quickly scan this list and identify any gaps that need to be filled in.  For each skill they can use the documented recipe to get one specific path that will work for them.
