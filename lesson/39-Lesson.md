## User Stories

### Product Requirements
* What must the website do?
* How must it be built?
* What are the trickiest features?

### User Perspective
* User Experience
* Describe all features as stories
* Prioritize the features
* Decide between Must Have - Nice to Have

### Tell the Story
* Lightweight Documentation
* 1 page for each day of work
* Just enough to get started
* Write for the customer


## Milestones

### Project Phases
Break a big project into phases

* Roughly comparable development time
* Three to four milestones
* Crawl, Walk, Run
* Core features first

### Deliverables
Identify specific deliverables for each phase

* List out specific features that must be implemented
* Think about dependencies
* Testing is part of each phase
* Prepare a killer demo

### Technical Tricks
Create inventory of technical tricks

* Forms entry, User Login, Image Carousel, Animated fades
* Identify any features where new skill is required
* 3 times to be effective
* Preparation is the key to success


## Task Breakdown

### Start with Milestones
* Work on one milestone at a time
* Fully plan the development
* Wait on planning remaining milestones
* You only need the next milestone

### Decompose each milestone
* What features must be created for this milestone?
* What sub-features are needed?
* Break it down until you get to 1-2 hour tasks
* Write an outline

### Unknown Tasks
* You have a clear view of what is known
* There is just as much that you don't know
* Make sure that you have 50% margin
* Estimate 1 day for any tricks you do not know


## Cost and Schedule

### Top-down Estimate
* Select project that is most similar to this
* How long did that take?
* How much can you leverage?
* Think through size of project

### Bottom-up Estimate
* Break down all milestones
* Factor in learning required
* Do yield to optimism
* People underestimate effort required
* Reconcile top-down and bottom-up views

### Skill Level
* What skills are your developers lacking
* It takes 1 day to learn a new trick
* Calculate effort to learn

### New Technology/New Market
* A new technology requires about 100 hours to be competent
* New market requires explicit pilot projects and tests
* Special factors are typically the most critical
* Planning is the key to a great project (do not rush this)
