## Good Software / Bad Software
What is the cost difference?

### Traditional Software Projects
* 7 engineers, manager, test team
* $300/year fully loaded
* $2 Million budget
* 9 month project ($1.5 M)

### Modern Practices
* 1-2 engineers, manager, test
* 1000 hours/project
* 6 month project ($100 K)

### Why the difference?
* Restricted goals
* Efficient work practices
* Automation
* Skilled workforce


## Scrum
Invented in 2001 by Ken Schwaber

* Reality in constantly changing
* Project plans MUST be flexibile
* Predictability can be forced by controls

### Project Management Model
* Principles of Software Development
* Best Practices
* Iterative cycles
* Customer feedback

### Intensive Iterations - Sprints
* Developers work in cycles
* Select features to build out
* Fully complete every new feature

### Feedback from Customer
* Live customer
* Demo the features
* Prioritize the feature list
* Appoint a surrogate customer if needed

### Singular focus of developers
* No interference
* No changes during sprint
* Do or die


## Sprints

### Sprint Planning Meeting
* Development team meets
* Update product backlog
* Select top tasks for next sprint
* Commit to new tasks

### Customer Feedback
* Demo of work done
* Gather feedback
* Prioritize backlog
* Agree to deliverables

### Developer Tasks
* Developers commit to tasks for sprint
* Must finish all tasks
* Each feature must be documented and tested


## Team Focus

### No interruption to team
* Team must be allowed to complete their work
* Ambiguous goals destroy motivation
* Dev team is booked with aggressive goals
* Management must agree

### No extra responsibilities
* Extra assignments are given between sprints
* To change responsibilities the sprint must be restarted
* No organizational changes are allowed during sprint
*

### Only committed features
* Dev team should be aggressive in picking goals
* The most important features are done next
* Demo is one showing current progress
* Schedule is full


## Push for Closure

### Full feature set
* No features are implement partially
* Functionality is deferred as a different feature
* Specific details are listed for each feature

### Full documentation
* Create just enough documentation
* Use outlines with bullet points
* Build a shared dashboard view of project

### Fully tested
* Build test cases for every feature
* Automate testing
* Selenium - Web Browser automation

### Aborted Sprints
* Handle the case where the work is not done
* Pulling the fire-alarm
* Must be balanced with practical concerns
