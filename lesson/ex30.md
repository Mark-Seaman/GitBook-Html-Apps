# Ex 30 - Using the Skills from Blog 5

## Identify your team
* Each of you is part of a design team with 4-5 members
* Locate the Blog 5 for each designer on your team
* If any designer does not have a correctly named blog then no action is
required by you for that designer
* Each designer has taught a development skill

## Create ex30.html
* Build a page that incorporates every programming feature documented by
your team
* Add some notes to your page to describe any difficulties that you had
in adding any features
* This allows each designer to improve their instructions

## Grading
This assignment will be graded as Blog 5b (the design review).  No
scorecard will be filled out on this round.  You will just apply the
ideas taught to your ex30 page.  No changes will be made to reviews.html.

Incorporating the ideas of others and building on them is an essential
part of every project in the real world.

There will not be a separate grade for Ex30.
