# Ex 33 - Select Organization for Blog

The Blog Project #7 is about helping an organization that you support
by building a marketing website.

This homework assignment will give you experience at both the technical
tasks and business interactions.

The ability to collaborate with others and understand their vision is
vital to your future success.

In Ex 33 you will research multiple organizations and find one that you
would like to help.  For this exercise you need to submit the top three
organizations that you considered and the final selection. Create a page
**ex33.html** that has that info.

Then state in 7-10 words what you believe to be the primary purpose of the
organization.  This is the beginning point for your marketing page for
Blog Project #7.
