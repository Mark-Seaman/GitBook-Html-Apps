# Ex 4 - Basic HTML

## Create a page as ex4.html
* Create ex4.html in your exercises folder in One Drive
* Create a link in your exercises/index.html page to point to ex4.html

## Start every page with a default template
* Visit the [template](templates/simple.html)
* Use view page source (^U) to copy the code
* Paste it into your template
* Fix the indents
* Save and test your page
* Upload it to the FTP server

## Review the HTML tags available
* Visit the [Template List](templates.html)
* Visit the [cheat sheet](templates/basic.html)
* Understand how to use the templates to create pages
* Use view page source (^U) to copy code from template files

## Create a blog post
* Build a page by copying and fixing up the HTML code
* Include the following elements on your page
    *  1 - [Headline](templates/headline.html)
    *  4 - [Subheading](templates/subhead.html)
    *  4 - [Paragraph](templates/paragraph.html)
    *  1 - [Bullet List](templates/bullets.html)
    *  2 - [Hyperlink](templates/hyperlink.html)
* Build the page structure first
* Test and deploy

## Write a blog post
An important part of every webpage is the information that is being
presented.  A fancy website with no purpose is worthless.
Writing good copy or supplying good information is critical to your
success.

The class not only teaches the mechanics of building web pages but it
will challenge you to write good content.  This exercise will give you
an opportunity to build a opinion sharing blog article.

Write a blog post to answer the following questions

* What inspires me?
* What motivates me to be more?
* What builds my loyalty and trust?
* How can I inspire others?

I've written an example article to demonstrate what is expected at
[http://bacs200.unco.edu/mark.seaman/exercises/ex4.html](http://bacs200.unco.edu/mark.seaman/exercises/ex4.html)

## Setup links to other page
* Add a link to ex4.html to go to ".." which is your home page
* Add a link to ex4.html to go to "/" which is the class web server

## Clean up any extra pages
* You may have extra pages in your One Drive or on the Web Server
* Fix both the local and remote files
    *  index.html
    *  exercises/index.html
    *  exercises/ex1.html
    *  exercises/ex2.html
    *  exercises/ex3.html
    *  exercises/ex4.html
    *  quiz/quiz1.html   (create a dir and move this file)

## Testing
* Test before deploy
* Validate your page [http://validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org)
* Why would you tolerate bad HTML?
* Three strikes rule

## Update Canvas
* Login to canvas and paste your URL into the assignment.
* Congratulations, you're done

## Partial Credit
* If you receive partial credit on this assignment you are eligible to resubmit
the work to receive full credit.
* Read the assignment feedback to see what problems your page has.
* Correct and test these issues then resubmit the page URL in canvas.   NOTE: If
you do not submit a new URL the exercise will not be regraded.

## Common Problems

### zero length files
There should never be a file of zero bytes uploaded to the server.  This always
indicates work that was never completed.

### clean up extra pages
You may have extra pages in your One Drive or on the Web Server.
Fix both the local and remote files
    *  index.html
    *  exercises/index.html
    *  exercises/ex1.html
    *  exercises/ex2.html
    *  exercises/ex3.html
    *  exercises/ex4.html
    *  quiz/quiz1.html   (create a dir and move this file)

### bad links on exercises
You have not properly implemented the exercises folder.  Every folder needs an
index.html file.  In this folder you need a list of all of the exercises.

### no blog article
You are missing the blog article for exercise 4.  There may be a file named 
exercise/ex4.html but it does not have the content required by the assignment.

### no exercises folder
You have not properly implemented the exercises folder.  Every folder needs an
index.html file.  In this folder you need a list of all of the exercises.

### no home page
You have not defined an index.html file in your student directory.  This is
required and acts as your home page.   Test your page by using the Students Website
test link.

### exercise has no link
The exercises/index.html should have links to all of the exercises that you 
have done so far.

### title on home page
The index.html file in your student directory does not have a good title or a 
good headline.  Both the title and h1 element should have meaningful content.

### invalid HTML
This page does not validate.   Make sure that the page passes the test performed
at [http://validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org)
