    ### Software is Central to Modern Life

    In 2011, Marc Andreessen famously stated that "Software is Eating the World".
    Every industry has experienced a remarkable transformation due to the growing
    dominance of software. Entire industries like bookstores, music stores, movie
    studios, newspapers, photography, and financial services, have been replaced by
    software-based services. Software is no longer a secondary player - it's the
    main show and will dictate whether your business succeeds or fails. Business now
    runs 24/7 and software is at the very heart of this amazing revolution.
