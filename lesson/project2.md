## Copywriting

Your goal for this exercise is to find your editorial voice.  BACS 200
teaches you to create websites for small businesses.  Websites are only
useful if they can persuade others.

Your article needs to take a clear editorial viewpoint.  You should
present a vision that others need to know.  Then you must try to
convince your readers of the logic of your arguments.  Bring them
around to your understanding and viewpoint.

Finally you should conclude with a call to action.  What do you
expect your readers to do as a result of reading your blog article?

People respond to writing that has three attributes:

* Character - Who are you as a person?  Are you reasonable or just a
complaining crack-pot?   Ethos
* Passion - Is what you are saying really heartfelt?  Or are you just
writing because you have to?  Pathos
* Logic - Does your writing have sound thinking behind it?  Does it
advance understanding? Logos

Writing that has these three elements hits the target.
