# Blog Article #3 - Due Friday, March 9

Write an article that describes the TED Talks movement.  Take on the
role of business reporter.  The audience for this piece is a group of
inquisitive but unaware college students.  Entice them to read your
article with a great headline.

Your article should be about 5 paragraphs or 200-300 words.  Tell about
the history of TED Talks and why you think this is important.  Include
a link to the website.   Highlight your favorite speaker and tell why
this talk was meaningful to you. Finish by giving a call to action.  What
