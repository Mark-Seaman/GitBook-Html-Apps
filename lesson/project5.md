# Blog Article #5 - Due Friday, March 30

For this project you will prepare a lesson for your classmate to teach
them a new web design skill.

The [w3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com)
has a wealth of information. Visit the
[examples section](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) to learn
a new skill.   Select the skill you are most interested in from the eight
pages of skills.

Your job is to create a page that teaches that skill to a classmate.
You will be creating a web page that uses all of the techniques that
we have learned so far to create a tutorial for the selected technical
trick.

The page should meet the following business requirements:

* Purpose of the page should be obvious within 10 seconds
* Information should follow a logical reading order
* Page should be visually appealing
* Readers should be led step-by-step to the result you want
* Include code for others to use (HTML inserted using iframe)
* So a running demo within your page
* Discuss why this trick is useful and when you should use it

The page should meet the following technical requirements:

* Linked stylesheet (unique to this blog)
