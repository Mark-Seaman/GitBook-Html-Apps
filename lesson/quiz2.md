### Step 1 - Create a file in your OneDrive account

* Type the required code for a valid HTML page

```html
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Quiz #2</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>My URLs</h1>
            <p>Puzzle 1: <a href="">UNC Root Page</a> (university website)</p>
            <p>Puzzle 2: <a href="">BACS 200 Web Server</a> (from top of server)</p>
            <p>Puzzle 3: <a href="">My Home Page</a> (from top of server)</p>
            <p>Puzzle 4: <a href="">Parent Directory</a> (one level up, my home page)</p>
            <p>Puzzle 5: <a href="">Exercises Directory</a> (sibling folder)</p>
            <p>Puzzle 6: <a href="">Quiz #1</a></p>
